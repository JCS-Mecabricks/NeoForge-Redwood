There now is a Redwood Biome and Dimension.
In Neoforge you need to craft a Redwood Portal block and stand in it to go to the Dimension.
It needs to be mined with an iron pick

This mod does not depend on TerraformersMC.

Lastly, I will mostly update my mods in modrinth: https://modrinth.com/user/JCS-Mecabricks
